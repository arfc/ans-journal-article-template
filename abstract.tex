Having an appropriate {\LaTeX} template available when writing new papers saves authors time and effort.
As of the summer of 2017, the American Nuclear Society (ANS) had not had a {\LaTeX} template for submissions to their three journals: Nuclear Science and Engineering (NSE), Nuclear Technology (NT), and Fusion Science and Technology (FST).
While such a template may have existed in one or more forms and enjoyed use in a subset of the nuclear engineering community, asking colleagues did not yield knowledge of such a template.
We therefore asked the ANS editors if they would be interested in such a template, iterated with them to create one which was in agreement with the journal submission guidelines, and have provided it for the journal community to use.
Submissions need not strictly adhere to a specific form beyond what is specified in the submission guidelines since ANS will reformat accepted submissions for publication, we expect that this template will speed up the publishing process for researchers working with ANS.
